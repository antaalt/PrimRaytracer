## Description
Didactic project to learn about OpenGL and raytracing. This is a toy path tracer which cannot be used as a renderer yet.

## TODO
- [x] Load and display glTF
- [x] Acceleration structure (Octree, BVH)
- [x] Multi sampling antialiasing
- [x] Optimizer Texture loading and manage both rgb and rgba, ldr and hdr
- [x] Ray sampling
- [ ] Mipmaping & anisotropy
- [ ] Sampler functions for random number
- [ ] Customise glTF for ray tracing
- [ ] Light implementation
- [ ] Correct camera implementation
- [ ] Depth of field
- [ ] Correct whitted tracer implementation
- [ ] Correct path tracer implementation
- [ ] Atmosphere simulation
- [ ] [...]
