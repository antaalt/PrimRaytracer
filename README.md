## Description
Didactic project to learn about OpenGL and raytracing.

## TODO
- [ ] merge common files into single lib
- [ ] separate game engine and ray engine

## TODO Engine
- [x] Load glTF / ASSIMP
- [ ] Light uniforms / time uniforms
- [ ] PBR shader
- [ ] Realistic camera movement (depending on time rather than frame)
- [ ] Vulkan
- [ ] Physic engine
- [ ] [...]

## TODO RayTracer
- [x] Load glTF
- [x] Acceleration structure (Octree, BVH)
- [ ] Optimizer Texture loading and manage both rgb and rgba, ldr and hdr
- [ ] Optimize memory (Sponza failing load bad_alloc)
- [ ] Remove temporary scene 
- [ ] Customise glTF for ray tracing
- [ ] Light implementation
- [ ] Correct whitted tracer implementation
- [ ] Correct path tracer implementation
- [ ] Sampler functions for random number
- [ ] Atmosphere simulation
- [ ] [...]
